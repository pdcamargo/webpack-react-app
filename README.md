### Webpack React App
It's a base template React app using our own webpack set up, alongside with `Babel`, `Typescript`, `ESLint` and `Prettier`.

We have a test setup as well with `Jest` and `@testing-library/react`;

The idea behind this project is to start a new React Project without `create-react-app` and without the need to every time make a whole new configuration from scratch.

Build for production
